MERN Restaurant App

This is a full-stack Restaurant Reservation Application built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
I created this project to learn how backend APIs connect with a React frontend and how real restaurant systems handle reservations.

The app allows users to view the restaurant details and submit a reservation request, which is then stored in MongoDB through a clean Express API.
The backend includes features like reservation creation, form validation, API routing, controllers, and database schema design.
On the frontend, I practiced building reusable components, integrating forms with API endpoints, and managing UI state.

This project helped me understand full-stack workflow, REST API development, and connecting React with a Node backend.
